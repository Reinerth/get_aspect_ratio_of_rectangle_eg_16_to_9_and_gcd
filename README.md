# get_aspect_ratio_of_rectangle_eg_16_to_9_and_gcd :desktop_computer:
Calculates the aspect ratio e.g. 16:9 of a rectangle (monitor or image)<br> 
and the Greatest Common Divisor (gcd) of two given numbers.<br> 
It is not the ratio number by dividing the sizes like 1024:768 = 1,333<br> 
This script gives you as result 16:9 and gcd = 120 <br>
if myWidth = 1920 and myHeight = 1080 are given.<br><br>
