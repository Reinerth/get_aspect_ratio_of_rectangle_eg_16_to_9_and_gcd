# get_aspect_ratio_of_rectangle_eg_16_to_9_and_gcd
Calculates the aspect ratio e.g. 16:9 of a rectangle (monitor or image) and the Greatest Common Divisor (gcd) of two given numbers. It is not the ratio number by dividing the sizes like 1024:768 = 1,333 This script gives you as result 16:9 and gcd = 120 if myWidth = 1920 and myHeight = 1080 are given.
